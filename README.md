# Steam Key Sorter
Easily remove unwanted characters, leaving behind steam keys for easy activation.

AutoKeySorter.py - reads the named file and outputs the sorted keys in a new file.
  - Edit the "test.txt" with your files name, and "2.txt" for the file output name

KeySorterManual.py - Manually enter data in place of "Steam Game - xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx"
  - Will display the results in the commandline and will exit on keys press.
